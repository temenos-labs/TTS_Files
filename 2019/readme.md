https://developer.temenos.com/index.php/community/register/

Choose the "Discover" Option and you will have access to our documentation and information for APIs.

If you do not already have an API key, this key will be active for the day of the event ONLY:

0opjVHGzkhL9MrDJnRa9DKGGPZkcmbqq

and you can use it anywhere that an API key is required for making test calls.

In additon, it is recommended that you install either Postman or Insomnia for making test API calls 
and if you are interested in writing code for the event we also recommend VSCode or a similar IDE for convenience.
